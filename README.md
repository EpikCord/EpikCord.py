Welcome to EpikCord.py!
This is an API Wrapper for Discord's API for Python!
We've decided not to fork discord.py and start completely from scratch for a new, better structuring system!

## Why EpikCord.py when Discord.py is back?
Discord.py is a little bit complicated.EpikCord.py is there because we want beginner developers to feel ease while, at the same time providing advanced developers many advanced features.

## I want to contribute!
We love contributions that help us, so feel free to! You won't be rewarded for this, but it helps us and we'd be very pleased with any contribution.
See the [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) page for more information.

## Where are your docs?
SoonTM

# Installing Epikcord.py

## Requirements

The minimal requirements for EpikCord.py is `Python>=3.8`. Python 3.7 and lower and Python 2 family are not supported

## Install
**Warning!**<Br>
This Library is in preview and hasn't been released yet. Some features may not work properly.

Get the library from the Python Package Index (PyPI)
<br>
```
pip install EpikCord.py
```

### Install in an Virtual Environment (venv)

Sometimes you might want to keep this library from conflicting with other libraries or use a different version of libs than the ones in the system. You also might not have permissions for installing libraries. Luckily Virtual Environments are here to save you. From Python3.3, there is a concept called Virtual Environment to help maintain these libs


#### For the quick and dirty:

1. Go to your project's working directory:

> ``` sh
>  $ cd bot-source-dir
>  $ python3 -m venv YourBotEnvName
> ```

2. Activate the venv
> For Linux/MacOS
> ```sh
>  $ source YourBotEnvName/bin/activate
> ```
> For Windows:
> ```
>  $ YourBotEnvName\Scripts\activate.ps1
> ```

3. Use pip as usual!
> ``` sh
> pip install -U EpikCord.py
> ```

Congrats! Your venv is all set up!
